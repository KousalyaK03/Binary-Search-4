# Approach:
# To find the median of two sorted arrays in O(log(min(m, n))) time, we use a binary search approach.
# We will partition the arrays such that the left half contains half of the elements and the right half contains the other half.
# The key is to ensure that the elements on the left are smaller than those on the right, while maintaining equal or nearly equal partition sizes.
# By adjusting the partition using binary search, we can find the median without fully merging the arrays.

# Time Complexity: O(log(min(m, n))), where m and n are the lengths of nums1 and nums2.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode: Yes, the code runs successfully and passes all test cases.
# Any problem you faced while coding this: No significant issues, but understanding and implementing the binary search partition technique was key.
